# Movies R&R 

My project is a creating a website for people to check out a movie's ratings and reviews. The inspiration for this website is a movie I have recently watched, Five Nights at Freddys' 2, which I have seen many people have mixed opinions on. I think having a website where you can easily look up ratings for movies and also check reviews is very convenient, and can also help decide whether or not you would want to watch the movie. 

## Design Process

For my design, I wanted to have a background of movie posters, but it was too bright and the movies I wanted to put up would be hard to see, so I added a translucent black overlay over the background. I put the search bar on the left, and popular recent movies on the right, as I took inspiration from a website, valorant tracker, and followed their layout. This website is for both casual movie watchers, and hardcore movie fanatics. I believe that casual movie watchers would use this website to decide whether a movie they want to watch is worth it to watch or not, instead of wasting their time and money. For hardcore movie fanatics, they can leave reviews and their thoughts on the movies they have watched to help others decide on whether they want to still watch the movie or not. It is easy to do this as my website will have all the movies, so you can check old movie reviews too, instead of only movies streaming in cinemas, which most cinemas already show reviews for. 

As a user, I want to leave a review, so others will not waste their time watching a bad movie.
